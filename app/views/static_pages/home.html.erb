  <p>This site was created to document my ongoing QA professional growth. I've taken online courses
>>>>>>> working
  to further my skill set.  I completed and passed a certficate course online from <a href="https://www.csusm.edu/el/programs/science-technology/certwebdev/index.html">CSUSM</a> for full stack developer in front-end development using HTML5,
  CSS, Javascript, and Jquery, and back-end developement using Ruby on Rails 6.0.  Also, I've taken Professional Development course from Udemy
  in Automation using Python with plugins for Robotframework and Selenium library. From trial and error and researching online I setup a Jenkins local
  machine to automatically execute a testsuite for the below web application. Currently, I'm focusing on REST API automation testing using Robotframework.  The links below redirect to all aspects of my end to end environment.</p>
  <p>Lastly, I want to thank  <a href="http://www.michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl</a> and his course <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> for teaching his skill set to students who want to learn.</p>
  </p>
   <h3>Web Application</h3>
   <p>Application created using Ruby on Rails 6.0 framework and HTML5/CSS3/javascript/jquery for UI. For development. Amazon'S cloud9 IDE and Heroku platform service were used. Both allows educational development using their Service for free. Thanks Amazon and Heroku!!</p>

   <h3>Source Control</h3>
   <p>Web Application/Automation Test code are located at remote respositories on bitbucket (due to easy integration for AWS Cloud9 IDE and Heroku) and github for automation code.</p>
  
   - <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coda92056/rubyonrails/src/master/">For Web Application Under Test  </a><br>
      Bitbucket Access granted by email invitaion.<br>
   - <a href="https://github.com/coda92056/master">For RobotFramework Test Cases</a></p>
   
   <h3>Automation</h3>
   <p>Automated Tests were created with Pycharm using Robotframework 3.0 and python v3.8.1 and selenium library v3.3.1.<br>Test Suite allows the script to run against 
   Edge, Firefox, Chrome browsers and executes different tests based on Tags for smoke and full testing.<br><br>
